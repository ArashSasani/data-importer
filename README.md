# data-importer
A Mixpanel data importer **Node** app for the data that you already have in your database and you want to export to [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
as events.

You only need to export your data which you want to import to Mixpanel as an event as a **json file** and the rest is ready :)

Check the [documenation](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/javascript) to understand it better.
