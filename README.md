# data-importer
A Mixpanel data importer **Node** app for the data that you already have and you want to export to [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
as events.

## Current acceptable inputs:
1. data that you have in your database or filesystem which you can export as a json file.
2. data you can retrieve from any API endpoint.

## You only need to:
1. [option A]export your data which you want to import to Mixpanel as an event as a **json file**. Please take a look at [data.json](https://github.com/ArashSasani/data-importer/blob/master/data.json).
2. [option B]call the API endpoint and get your event data as **json format**

*The rest is ready* :)
Just call **npm start**.

Check the [Mixpanel documenation](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/javascript) if you want to understand the code better.
